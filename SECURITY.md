### Skill Files (`skills/*/`)

- Insecure code examples that developers may copy into production
- Outdated or misleading security guidance
- Recommendations that contradict current best practices

### Hook Shell Scripts (`hooks/*.sh`)

- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Unsafe path handling
- Unintended code execution

### Plugin Manifest & MCP Config (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`)

- Excessive permissions
- Exploitable MCP server definitions
